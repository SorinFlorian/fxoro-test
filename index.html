        <p>Risk disclaimer</p>
        <p>
          CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money
          rapidly due to leverage. 75.28% of retail investor accounts lose money
          when trading CFDs with this provider. You should consider whether you
          understand how CFDs work and whether you can afford to take the high
          risk of losing your money.
        </p>
        <p>
          The National Securities Market commission of Spain (the “CNMV”) has
          determined that, due to the complexity of CFDs and the risks involved,
          the purchase of such a product by Retail Clients is not
          appropriate/suitable. In this respect, pursuant to the relevant
          requirements introduced by CNMV, you are warned that you are about to
          purchase a product that is complex and difficult to understand:
          Contracts for Differences (CFDs). CNMV has determined that, due to its
          complexity and the risks involved, the purchase of this product by
          retail investors is not appropriate/suitable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of such, CFDs may not be the ideal investment for everyone.
          The high rate of leverage that is available to CFD traders can work
          for or against you. You should only invest money that you can afford
          to lose. CFDs are intricate leveraged financial assets. Trading Forex,
          Commodities, Indexes and Shares based CFDs, or any other underlaying
          instruments of the Company implies a high degree of risk and can lead
          to the loss of your investment. Before getting involved with trading,
          consider your financial goals, your skills and gage the possible risks
          associated with trading Company’s Products. Derivate assets like CFDs
          and likely instruments from other markets can present extreme
          volatility. CFDs may shift price rapidly and may depict change in
          market conditions that result from unforeseeable occurrences. None of
          these facts can be manipulated by either you or FXORO. It is best to
          consult with a licensed financial counselor. FXORO does not avail its
          customers with financial advice and the information provided herein is
          intended for marketing purposes only. Past performance is not an

          Products.
